Data Science Capstone Project

Business Question:
If a new business venture wants to open a dog grooming business, where should they open their store? They want to be able to attract foot traffic from nearby venues. 
As a data scientist, I will identify the neighborhoods which have the most parks, dog walks, and restaurants. These are venues that dog owners frequent often, 
and a new business should be close to these venues to generate the most revenue. 

I can use the FourSquare location API to locate venues in the area that are in the neighborhoods and categorize them. 
From these data points, I will be able to identify neighborhoods in Toronto that are close in proximity to the venues specified. 
These are the types of venues that will attract future customers, and if a store front is close to these venues, they will be able to attract 
customers from foot traffic.
